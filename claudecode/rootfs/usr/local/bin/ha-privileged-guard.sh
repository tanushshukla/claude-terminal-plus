# ha-privileged-guard.sh - Claude Code PreToolUse hook for the Claude Code
# Home Assistant app. It enforces a privileged-action boundary (issue #29):
# some actions can take Home Assistant offline or need physical access to
# recover, so Claude must not run them autonomously.
#
# Why a hook and not just permissions.deny: Claude Code permission rules match
# an MCP tool only by NAME, not by the arguments inside the call. The dangerous
# calls here are ordinary `call_service_tool` invocations whose {domain,service}
# happens to be destructive, so a name-level deny would either block every
# service call or none. This hook reads the actual arguments and decides.
#
# Trust model: the destructive baseline (BUILTIN_DENY / BUILTIN_CONFIRM) is
# hard-coded HERE, in a script that lives on the read-only /usr/local tree
# (AppArmor: /usr/local/** is ixr). The writable policy file can only ADD to the
# baseline, never remove from it, and if that file is missing or corrupt the
# hook fails CLOSED to the baseline rather than open. So config drift, an
# accidental wipe, or an interrupted session cannot silently disable the floor.
# The one lever that disables the guard is an explicit {"enabled":false}, which
# is what the app writes when guard_privileged_actions is turned off. A fully
# adversarial agent with shell write access can still tamper with its own
# settings; this is a strong safety net against mistakes and drift, not a
# sandbox against deliberate self-sabotage.
#
# Contract (Claude Code PreToolUse hook):
#   - Full tool call arrives as JSON on stdin: {tool_name, tool_input, ...}.
#   - To let the normal permission flow proceed, exit 0 with no stdout.
#   - To block or gate, print a decision object on stdout and exit 0:
#       {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse",
#         "permissionDecision":"deny"|"ask","permissionDecisionReason":"..."}}
#     "deny" blocks outright; "ask" forces an interactive human confirmation.
#
# Every vector (MCP call_service_tool, the restart_ha convenience tool, and
# shell commands via curl / the `ha` CLI) is reduced to canonical
# "domain.service" ids, then looked up in the effective lists.
