# ha-guard-configure.sh - boot-time configurator for the privileged-action
# guard (issue #29). Called once from the app boot script after the Claude Code
# settings file exists. It:
#   1. Reads the guard options from /data/options.json.
#   2. Writes the policy the runtime hook reads (/root/.claude/ha-guard.json).
#   3. Wires (or, when disabled, unwires) the PreToolUse hook and a small fixed
#      fail-closed permissions.deny floor into the Claude Code settings file.
#
# All settings edits are idempotent (safe to run on every boot) and preserve
# any hooks / deny rules the user added themselves. Kept as a standalone rootfs
# script, not inline in the Dockerfile CMD, so it stays readable and lintable
# (same rationale as the .bashrc / .tmux.conf split in issue #26).

# Fixed, non-configurable settings-level deny floor for the handful of shell
# commands that have no legitimate autonomous use in this app. This is
# fail-closed defense in depth: permissions.deny is enforced by Claude Code
# itself even if the PreToolUse hook is somehow bypassed. Reading logs with
# `ha core logs` / `ha core info` stays allowed - only lifecycle verbs are here.
#
# SCOPE, honestly: permissions.deny rules are literal command-PREFIX matches, so
# this floor can only cover the `ha` CLI, and only the block-tier verbs (never
# `ha core restart`, which is confirm-tier and legitimate with a human OK). It
# does NOT cover a curl to the Supervisor API, nor leading global flags
# (`ha --raw core stop`). Those rely on the hook, which reads structured
# arguments. The floor lists the documented cobra aliases for each verb
# (`ha ha`/`ha homeassistant`/`ha home-assistant` for core, `ha ho` for host,
# `ha su`/`ha super` for supervisor, `ha hassos` for os) so the most obvious
# spellings are covered even without the hook.
